# About me

### History

I grew up in south Florida and attended the University of South Florida in Tampa. During school I worked at the National Renewable Energy Lab doing research in areas such as materials & chemical informatics, machine learning, and first-principles material modeling. I graduated with my B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering in 2017 and I am currently a graduate researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the Quantum Computing Group and enrolled for a Ph.D. at the University of Tennessee.

### Interests

My current research focuses on quantum computing, specifically algorithms and applications to physics simulation. However I am also interested in scientific visualization and science education. Hopefully I'll get to do a bit of everything. In my spare time I enjoy mountain biking and listening to funk/soul music.
