# About me

### History

I grew up in south Florida and attended the University of South Florida in Tampa. During school I worked at the National Renewable Energy Lab doing research in areas such as materials & chemical informatics, machine learning, and first-principles material modeling. I graduated with my B.Sc. in Chemical Engineering in 2017 and am currently waiting to attend graduate school.

### Interests

My interests are pretty broad and range from aspects of applied math and statistics to quantum computing, visualization, and science education. Hopefully I'll get to do a bit of everything. In my spare time I enjoy mountain biking and listening to funk/soul music.
